# Project Title

Social Video App.

### Design Pattern

* Followed MVVM Design Pattern:
  
  Model–View–ViewModel (MVVM) is a software architectural pattern that facilitates the separation of the development of the GUI (the view) from the development of the business logic or back-end logic (the model) so that the view is not dependent on any specific model platform. The ViewModel of MVVM is responsible for exposing the data objects from the model in such a way that objects are easily managed and presented.
  In this respect, the ViewModel is more model than view and handles most if not all of the view’s display logic. The ViewModel may implement a mediator pattern, organizing access to the back-end logic around the set of use cases supported by the view.

### Languages
